Measurement Descriptions and Units
Real Time files generally contain the last 45 days of "Realtime" data - data that went through automated quality checks and were distributed as soon as they were received. Historical files have gone through post-processing analysis and represent the data sent to the archive centers. The formats for both are generally the same, with the major difference being the treatment of missing data. Missing data in the Realtime files are denoted by "MM" while a variable number of 9's are used to denote missing data in the Historical files, depending on the data type (for example: 999.0 99.0).

General
Units: Station pages display the current hour's measurements in Imperial units by default, but can be changed by the viewer to metric units. When accessing Real Time and Historical data files, the measurements are generally in metric units, as described below, and cannot be changed.

Time: Station pages show current observations in station local time by default, but can be changed by the viewer to UTC (formerly GMT). Both Realtime and Historical files show times in UTC only. See the Acquisition Time help topic for a more detailed description of observation times. For more information on the times in the files, see the changes page.

Station ID: Five-digit WMO Station Identifier, used since 1976. ID's can be reassigned to future deployments within the same 1 degree square.

Formats: Data are classified according to the following groups. The header lines are shown at the beginning of group. Note that in the Realtime files, non-data lines begin with "#". Such lines should be treated as comment lines.

HEAT	For more information on heat index, please see the NWS Heat Wave page.
CHILL	Please note that NDBC uses unadjusted winds to calculate wind chill. The winds are calculated at anemometer height. For more information on wind chill, please see the NWS Wind Chill Temperature Index.
ICE	Estimated ice accretion in inches per hour based on an algorithm developed by Overland and Pease at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in the mid-1980s. The algorithm relates icing to the presently observed wind speed, air temperature, and sea surface temperature. The method is designed for trawlers in the 20 to 75 meter length range, underway at normal speeds in open seas and not heading downwind. In general, NWS forecasters translate ice accretion rates to the following categories:
light: 0.0 to 0.24 inches of ice accretion/hour;
moderate: 0.25 to 0.8 inches/hour; and
heavy: greater than 0.8 inches/hour.
WSPD10	The estimation of Wind Speed (WSPD) measurement raised or lowered to a height of 10 meters. NDBC uses the method of Liu et al., 1979: Bulk parameterization of air-sea exchanges in heat and water vapor including molecular constraints at the interface, Journal of Atmospheric Science, 36, pp. 1722-1735.
WSPD20	The estimation of Wind Speed (WSPD) measurement raised or lowered to a height of 20 meters. NDBC uses the method of Liu et al., 1979: Bulk parameterization of air-sea exchanges in heat and water vapor including molecular constraints at the interface, Journal of Atmospheric Science, 36, pp. 1722-1735.

Sep_Freq	The Separation Frequency is the frequency that separates wind waves (WWH, WWP, WWD) from swell waves (SWH, SWP,SWD). NDBC inserts the value 9.999 if Sep_Freq is missing.
Spectral wave density	Energy in (meter*meter)/Hz, for each frequency bin (typically from 0.03 Hz to 0.40 Hz).
Spectral wave direction	Mean wave direction, in degrees from true North, for each frequency bin. A list of directional stations is available.
Directional Wave Spectrum	= C11(f) * D(f,A), f=frequency (Hz), A=Azimuth angle measured clockwise from true North to the direction wave is from.
D(f,A) = (1/PI)*(0.5+R1*COS(A-ALPHA1)+R2*COS(2*(A-ALPHA2))). R1 and R2 are the first and second normalized polar coordinates of the Fourier coefficients and are nondimensional. ALPHA1 and ALPHA2 are respectively mean and principal wave directions.
In terms of Longuet-Higgins Fourier Coefficients
R1 = (SQRT(a1*a1+b1*b1))/a0
R2 = (SQRT(a2*a2+b2*b2))/a0
ALPHA1 = 270.0-ARCTAN(b1,a1)
ALPHA2 = 270.0-(0.5*ARCTAN(b2,a2)+{0. or 180.})
Notes:
The R1 and R2 values in the monthly and yearly historical data files are scaled by 100, a carryover from how the data are transported to the archive centers. The units are hundredths, so the R1 and R2 values in those files should be multiplied by 0.01.
D(f,A) can take on negative values because of the trigonometric sine and cosine functions. There are several approaches to prevent or deal with the negative values. For more information and discussion of some approaches see: Use of advanced directional wave spectra analysis methods, M. D. Earle, K. E. Steele, and D. W. C. Wang, Ocean Engineering, Volume 26, Issue 12, December 1999, Pages 1421-1434.
ALPHA2 has ambiguous results in using the arctangent function with the Fourier Coefficients,b 2 ,a 2 . When necessary, NDBC adds 180 degrees to ALPHA2 in order to minimize the difference between ALPHA 1 and ALPHA2.
